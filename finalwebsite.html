        <h1>What is Hip-Hop?</h1>
        <p>Hip hop is more than a genre: it’s a cultural movement sweeping up music, poetry, dance, art, fashion, and political philosophy. A lot of people use rap and hip-hop synonymously, but strictly speaking hip-hop is a cultural movement (including music), whereas rap is a specific musical technique often employed in hip-hop music. There are seen to be 4 pillars of hip-hop: Rapping, Emceeing, Dancing, and Street Expression through the forms of art.

        <h1>What is the origin of Hip-Hop?</h1>
        <p>Hip hop began as a culture and art movement in the Bronx, where demographics were rapidly shifting in the early 1970s. During the 1950s and 60s, many white, middle-class people left the cities to move to the suburbs. The African Americans and Latino Americans that were left behind in cities encountered many challenges in their neighborhoods, as budgets were slashed and resources diverted to the wealthier, whiter communities. Faced with a lack of economic opportunity, as well as rising crime and poverty rates, the young people in the Bronx and nearby communities began creating their own kinds of cultural expressions. These forms of expression would come together to form the four pillars of hip hop.</p>

        <h1>Why is Hip-Hop misunderstood?</h1>
        <p>Hip-Hop Culture has often been misunderstood and misrepresented with negative connotations, with mainstream media pushing a narrative that doesn’t hold true to the origins of the artform. You sometimes see hip-hop associated with bad language or misogyny, or glorifying crime, violence, drug use – and sometimes you do see musicians glamorising substance abuse or crime. But this doesn’t hold true to what hip-hop is at its core, which is a culture built on values of social justice, peace, respect, self-worth, community, and having fun. Hip-hop was actually created to challenge the status quo and to enable, empower and showcase those groups and individuals that had been cast aside by social elites.</p>
